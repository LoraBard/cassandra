/**
 * Type of scheduled TPC task. The type of task has an effect on how the task is scheduled and counted.
 *
 * The task type is used for several purposes:
 * - To count how many tasks each TPC core has in flight. Most tasks end up in the scheduler's queue and are
 *   automatically counted, but others wait to be triggered by an external event (e.g. async read) and need to be
 *   explicitly marked as active.
 * - To identify "pendable" tasks which are delayed if too many tasks are currently in flight on the given core.
 *   Pendable tasks are usually the ones that start the work on a request. Also pendable tasks can be
 *   "backpressured", which means the event loop will further delay their processing if the max pending limit is hit.
 *   This is done to avoid having an operation's
 *   state in memory while the task has no chance to finish quickly, which causes severe GC problems as temporary
 *   objects get promoted to long-lived.
 * - To display an event name associated with the type of task in the list of active, completed, pending and blocked
 *   operations in the TPC metrics.
 * - To decide if a task should be counted in the metrics only if it forces a delay in the processing (e.g. thread
 *   switching), or every time it is executed.
 * - To decide whether or not to include some types of operation in the per-core totals.
 *
 * The comment above each task type is to be used for event description in the documentation.
