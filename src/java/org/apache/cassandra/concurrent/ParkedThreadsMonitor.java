/**
 * This class is responsible for keeping tabs on threads that register as a {@link MonitorableThread}.
 *
 * When a {@link MonitorableThread} parks itself this thread wakes it up when work is ready.
 * This allows Threads to (for example) use a non-blocking queue without constantly spinning.
 *
 * The watcher will call {@link MonitorableThread#shouldUnpark(long)} and when that
 * method returns true, unparks the thread.  When the thread has no work left it parks itself.
 *
 * It's upto the {@link MonitorableThread#shouldUnpark(long)} implementation to track its own state.
