/**
 * Incremental builders of on-disk tries which packs trie stages into disk cache pages.
 *
 * The incremental core is as in {@code IncrementalTrieWriterSimple}, which this augments by:
 *   - calculating branch sizes reflecting the amount of data that needs to be written to store the trie
 *     branch rooted at each node
 *   - delaying writing any part of a completed node until its branch size is above the page size 
 *   - laying out (some of) its children branches (each smaller than a page) to be contained within a page
 *   - adjusting the branch size to reflect the fact that the children are now written (i.e. removing their size)
 * The process is bottom-up, i.e. pages are packed at the bottom and the root page is usually smaller. This is not
 * optimally efficient as the root page is normally always in cache and we should be using the most of it. Unfortunately
 * this is unavoidable for an incremental process.
 * 
 * As an example, taking a sample page size fitting 4 nodes, a simple trie would be split like this:
 * Node 0 |
 *   -a-> | Node 1
 *        |   -s-> Node 2
 *        |          -k-> Node 3 (payload 1)
 *        |          -s-> Node 4 (payload 2)
 *        -----------------------------------
 *   -b-> Node 5 |
 *          -a-> |Node 6
 *               |  -n-> Node 7
 *               |         -k-> Node 8 (payload 3)
 *               |                -s-> Node 9 (payload 4)
 * where lines denote page boundaries.
 * 
 * The process itself will start by adding "ask" which adds three nodes after the root to the stack. Adding "ass"
 * completes Node 3, setting its branch a size of 1 and replaces it on the stack with Node 4.
 * The step of adding "bank" starts by completing Node 4 (size 1), Node 2 (size 3), Node 1 (size 4), then adds 4 more
 * nodes to the stack. Adding "banks" descends one more node.
 * The trie completion step completes nodes 9 (size 1), 8 (size 2), 7 (size 3), 6 (size 4), 5 (size 5). Since the size
 * of node 5 is above the page size, the algorithm lays out its children. Nodes 6, 7, 8, 9 are written in order. The
 * size of node 5 is now just the size of it individually, 1. The process continues with completing Node 0 (size 6).
 * This is bigger than the page size, so some of its children need to be written. The algorithm takes the largest,
 * Node 1, and lays it out with its children in the file. Node 0 now has an adjusted size of 2 which is below the
 * page size and we can continue the process.
 * Since this was the root of the trie, the current page is padded and the remaining nodes 0, 5 are written.
