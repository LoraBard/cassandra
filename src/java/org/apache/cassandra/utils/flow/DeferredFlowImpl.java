/**
 * Implementation of {@link DeferredFlow}.
 *
 * Record the source flow into an atomic reference and when, both subscriber and source flow
 * are available start requesting items, provided the subscriber has made a request. Once both
 * subscriber and source flow are available, this class is a simple bridge that subscribes the
 * subscriber directly to the source flow.
 * <p>
 * The complexity lies in coordinating the client requests with the availability of the source
 * flow, without relying on the synchronized keyword.
 * <p>
 * Two enums control the subscription and request status and they ensure that the first request,
 * or an initial close with no request, are performed exactly once.
