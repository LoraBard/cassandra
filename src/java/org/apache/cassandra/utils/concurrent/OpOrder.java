/**
 * <p>A class for providing synchronization between producers and consumers that do not
 * communicate directly with each other, but where the consumers need to process their
 * work in contiguous batches. In particular this is useful for both CommitLog and Memtable
 * where the producers (writing threads) are modifying a structure that the consumer
 * (flush executor) only batch syncs, but needs to know what 'position' the work is at
 * for co-ordination with other processes,
 *
 * <p>The typical usage is something like:
 * <pre>
 * {@code

// seal() MUST be called after newBarrier() else barrier.isAfter()
// will always return true, and barrier.await() will fail
state.barrier.issue();

// wait for all producer work started prior to the barrier to complete
state.barrier.await();

// change the shared state to its replacement, as the current state will no longer be used by producers
