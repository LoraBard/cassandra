/**
 * <p>A class for providing synchronization between producers and consumers that do not
 * communicate directly with each other, but where the consumers need to process their
 * work in contiguous batches. In particular this is useful for both CommitLog and Memtable
 * where the producers (writing threads) are modifying a structure that the consumer
 * (flush executor) only batch syncs, but needs to know what 'position' the work is at
 * for co-ordination with other processes,
 *
 * <p>The typical usage is something like:
