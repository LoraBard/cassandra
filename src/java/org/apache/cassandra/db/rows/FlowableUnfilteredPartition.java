/**
 * A partition container providing access to the rows of the partition together with deletion information.
 * <p>
 * The supplied {@code PartitionHeader} contains partition top-level information.
 * The content is a flowable stream of {@code Unfiltered}, that is of either {@code Row} or {@code RangeTombstoneMarker}.
 * An unfiltered partition <b>must</b> provide the following guarantees:
 *   1. the returned {@code Unfiltered} must be in clustering order, or in reverse clustering
 *      order iff {@code header.isReverseOrder} is true.
 *   2. the iterator should not shadow its own data. That is, no deletion
 *      (partition level deletion, row deletion, range tombstone, complex
 *      deletion) should delete anything else returned by the iterator (cell, row, ...).
 *   3. every "start" range tombstone marker should have a corresponding "end" marker, and no other
 *      marker should be in-between this start-end pair of marker. Note that due to the
 *      previous rule this means that between a "start" and a corresponding "end" marker there
 *      can only be rows that are not deleted by the markers. Also note that when iterating
 *      in reverse order, "end" markers are returned before their "start" counterpart (i.e.
 *      "start" and "end" are always in the sense of the clustering order).
 *
 * Note: providers of data can no longer reuse mutable returned objects as we can't guarantee only one reference
 * exists at a time (e.g. Flowable.concatMap always requests one in reserve).
