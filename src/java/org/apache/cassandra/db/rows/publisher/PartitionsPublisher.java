     * <p>
     * In addition to recursions, we also need to handle races between the request loop and onNext, which
     * could be called from a different thread at any time.
     * <p>
     * This is handled with a small state machine that controls whether we are in the loop and whether an
     * item has been received. The call to request is a no-op if we are already in the loop. Once in the loop,
     * after calling request we try to exit the loop, but if {@link RequestLoop#onNext(Object)} has been called
     * recursively or has raced with the request loop, then we fail to exit the loop and continue with the next
     * request. onNext will try to transition from in_loop_requested to in_loop_ready and if it succeeds then
     * it is done since the loop is still in place, if it instead has failed then we must be out of the loop and
