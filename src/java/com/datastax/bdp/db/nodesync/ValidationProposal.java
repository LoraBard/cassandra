/**
 * A proposal for the validation of a particular segment.
 * <p>
 * The main purpose of this class is to implement priorities amongst competing possible NodeSync validations. Namely,
 * multiple {@link ValidationProposer} submit proposals to the {@link ValidationScheduler}, which sorts those proposals
 * and schedule them in ascending order. When a proposal is finally scheduled for execution, it is activated
 * ({@link #activate()}) to create the actual {@link Validator} that is executed.
 * <p>
 * This class is abstract and each {@link ValidationProposer} sub-class will generally implement its own variant. However, for
 * the reason above, all proposal sub-class should be comparable with any other proposal. To make that meaningful, this
 * class define a basic priority scheme based on 2 elements: 1) each proposal has a numeric priority level where the
 * lowest priority level proposal should always have priority and 2) on similar priority level, proposals are ordered
 * by their creation time.
