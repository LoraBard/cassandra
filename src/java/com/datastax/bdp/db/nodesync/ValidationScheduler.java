/**
 * Continuously schedules the segment validations to be ran (by an {@link ValidationExecutor}) for NodeSync.
 * <p>
 * There is 2 types of validations that the scheduler deals with:
 * - normal 'continuous' NodeSync validations.
 * - user triggered user validations.
 * <p>
 * For the first kind, the scheduler maintains for each NodeSync-enable table a corresponding
 * {@link ContinuousValidationProposer}. it then "multiplex" the proposal of all those per-table continuous proposer to
 * provide the next validation that should be performed.
 * <p>
 * For the second kind, user validations, those are manually submitted by users through JMX. User validations always
 * take precedence over continuous ones, so continuous validations will basically "pause" as soon as a user validation
 * comes in. The scheduler will then schedule all the validation of that user validation and only resume continous
 * validations once the user validation is finished. If a new user validation comes while another one is running, it
 * will queue up behind that running validation (and any previously queued user validations).
 * <p>
 * Note that priority between proposals is not decided by this class but is rather directly implemented by the
 * comparison on {@link ValidationProposal}, so this class main job is to merge the proposal from multiple proposers
 * in a way that respects priority and is thread-safe (individual {@link ValidationProposer} are not thread-safe but
 * {@link ValidationExecutor} is multi-threaded).
 * <p>
 * This class and all it's publicly-visible methods <b>ARE</b> thread-safe.
