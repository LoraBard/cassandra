/**
 * An executor for validations on segments for NodeSync.
 * <p>
 * This class job is to pull {@link Validator} objects from a {@link ValidationScheduler} and run them (using the
 * {@link Validator#executeOn(ValidationExecutor)} method).
 * <p>
 * The main parameter that this class controls is 1) how many concurrent validations we allow and 2) how many threads
 * we use to run those validations. Note that running a validation involves many blocking parts (waiting on disk or
 * replicas) and so we don't dedicate a thread to each validation.
 * <p>
 * This class has an auto-adjusting component to it in that it tries to auto-adjust the number of concurrent validations
 * and threads so as to find the combination that allows us to best achieve our target NodeSync rate
 * ({@link NodeSyncConfig#getRate()}). For that, it checks and uses the following at regular intervals:
 *   - how much time thread spends doing nothing useful: if it's really low, we may benefit from an additional thread,
 *     and it's high, we may do as well without one.
 *   - how much time is spend waiting on the limiter to give us permits: if it's too high, this suggests we have too
 *     much concurrent validations going on.
 *   - the recent rate of validation: if it's below our configured rate, we should be trying to do more concurrent
 *     validations.
 * Of course, to avoid problems, we put limit over how much maximum threads and concurrent validations we're willing to
 * allow (in {@link NodeSyncConfig}): if we can't achieve the configured rate with those max settings, this suggest
 * we either have set a unrealistic NodeSync rate that the node is not able to achieve, or that we've been too
 * conservative in our configured maximums. See the {@link Controller} class for concrete details on that auto-adjustment
 * process.
